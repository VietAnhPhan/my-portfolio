### The builder who turns ideas into working products.

I'm a Backend developer specializing in Laravel and Node.js, passionate about creating meaningful, user-focused web applications. My journey in technology began back in 2014, when I typed my first lines of Pascal. That moment — watching a small idea become something real on screen — hooked me for life. Since then, I’ve been driven by curiosity, creativity, and the joy of building things that work.

Over the years, I’ve developed everything from personal passion projects to production-ready platforms. I love working across the stack — designing intuitive interfaces, building scalable APIs, and delivering smooth, reliable user experiences end to end.

What makes me different is how I learn. I’m an eager and fast learner, constantly improving, adapting, and absorbing new tools and ideas. Give me a problem, and I’ll understand it, break it down, and build the solution.

When we work together, you’re not just getting a developer who writes code — you’re getting someone who thinks, collaborates, and cares about outcomes.

If you’re building something new — or need someone who can jump in and move fast — I’m here to help you bring it to life.
